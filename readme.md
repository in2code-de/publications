# publications is an TYPO3 extension to list academic publications

Inspired by the TYPO3 **bib** extension



## Introduction

Target group of this extension are universities and colleges:
Show academic publications in a listview with some filter possibilities in the plugin and in frontend.
Im- and export BibTeX or XML files (Import via Backend Module, Export in Frontend) to list publications.
Easily extend this extension with own importers or own citestyles.

At the moment we support a default and the IEEE citestyle.

## Technical requirements

This extension needs *TYPO3 12*
At the moment it's not possible to use publications without **composer mode**! Classic mode is not supported.


## Installation

* Install the extension via composer: `composer require in2code/publications`
* Clean caches
* Add the static TypoScript of the extension to your installation root template
* Add some publication and author records to a sysfolder
* Add the publication plugin to a default page
* That's it



## Extending publications

* Look at the [importer documentation](Documentation/Importer.md) to see how you can add own importers
* Look at the [citestyle documentation](Documentation/Citestyles.md) to see how you can add your own cite styles



## Migration from bib

If you want to migrate records from extension bib to publications, there is a Command Controller for doing this

```
./vendor/bin/typo3cms publications:migrate
```

**Note:** If you want to delete all publications records before (to minimize uid conflicts), you can use

```
# Delete all records (truncate all tables)
./vendor/bin/typo3cms publications:clean 0

# Delete all records on page with uid 123
./vendor/bin/typo3cms publications:clean 123
```

## Check and fix code style

This project uses php-cs-fixer to check for PHP coding standards.
For a list of the used rules see: `.project/tests/.php-cs-fixer.php`.

Run the PHP code style test (local):
```
ddev ssh
composer  test:php:cs
```

Automatic fix of code style violations:

This command tries to fix code violations automatically.
This works for the most violations (indent, spaces etc.).
If an automatic fix is not possible the fixes must be done manually.
```
ddev ssh
./.build/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --config=.project/tests/.php-cs-fixer.php --diff
```
